# Node.js + MongoDB

This is a study project of Node.js with MongoDB, through the Mongoose library.

We're using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to manage our infrastructure (as database and other services). After installing docker-compose in your machine, just run `docker-compose up -d` to set up everything.

Don't forget to set your `.env` file. You can duplicate the `.env.example` file. If you won't change anything in the `docker-compose.yaml`, then you won't need to change anything in the `.env` file as well.
